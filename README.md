## Exercism
Exercism exercises in functional programming languages like Clojure, Elixir, Elm, Haskell Scala, Lisp, Erlang, Purescript, F# or Scheme.

## Folder structure

* name_of_the_language
    * name_of_the_exercise

The exercise folder should contain a README.md and the source code.

In case there's already a solution just change the name of the folder:

* name_of_the_language
    * foobar
    * foobar_2
