# Difference Of Squares

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

## Elm Installation

installation and learning resources.

## Writing the Code

Just write it! It's in `src/DifferenceOfSquares.elm`.

In order to run tests, install a test utility with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g elm-test@beta
```

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

Automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
